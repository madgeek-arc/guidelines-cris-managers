FAIR enabled
============

The OpenAIRE and DRIVER guidelines, at the beginning of their time in `2006 <https://www.openaire.eu/history>`_, had already put the focus on elements that can be found today in the FAIR principles.
Community-based refinement and enhancement of the guidelines over time to include elements with their descriptions that are consistent with motivation of FAIR.

`OpenAIRE <https://www.openaire.eu>`_ and `euroCRIS <https://www.eurocris.org>`_ are proud to announce a dedicated report focusing on the principles of *F*indable, *A*ccessible, *I*nteroperable, and *R*eusable (FAIR) in relation to the CRIS guideline.

The ''Report on compliance with the RDA FAIR Principles in the OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers''
is based on the OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers version 1.1.1 `[10.5281/zenodo.2316420] <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2316420>`_. The report is freely available at ZENODO, `[10.5281/zenodo.6953713] <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6953713>`_.
